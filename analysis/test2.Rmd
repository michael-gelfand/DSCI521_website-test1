## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r code chunk title, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
x <- rnorm(100)

mean(x, na.rm = FALSE)

hist(x, main = "history of random numbers", col = "skyblue")

message("this is a sample message")
```

```{r loading cars in csv}
# cars2 <- read.csv("data/cars.csv")
```
I am testing the here package

```{r testing here}
library(here)
hello <- here("data/cars.csv")

cars3 <- read.csv(hello)
```
```{r}
getwd()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
